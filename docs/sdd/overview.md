# Software design overview

## Software static architecture

### Component view
The software is the single Python package `s2_msi_raw_generator` (one CSC). Modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `sensor.py` | Sentinel-2 sensor model — harvested constants: bands, GSD, physical gains, Lref/SNR, integration time, TDI/SWIR sets, per-unit SRF (centre/bandwidth/equivalent wavelength), noise model α/β, dark pedestal, EQ-gain stability, quantization. `Band` dataclass (`.dn_ref`, `.cal_gain`, `.dark_dsnu`). |
| `gipp.py` | Original parser of the  operational S2A GIPP XML → per-pixel arrays: R2EQOG (dark `COEFF_D` + cubic/bilinear relative-response gains), R2DEPI (defective), BLINDP (blind), R2PARA (offsets/flags), R2CRCO (crosstalk). |
| `adf.py` | Per-band ADF assembly:S2 PSF matrices (`data/psf/`), noise coefficients; builds `BandADF` `from_gipp` / `from_product` / `synthesize`. |
| `forward_radiometric_atbd.py` | Original implementation of the public L1 ATBD on-ground model $Z = X - D$, $Y = G(Z)$ and its **exact inverse** — the round-trip bridge. |
| `reverse.py` | The reverse radiometric chain — one pure-NumPy function per ATBD §5 step, plus the `reverse_mvp` / `reverse_full` chains and the exact-inverse `reverse_radiometric` / `forward_radiometric` bridge. |
| `calibration.py` | In-flight two-reference calibration sub-set: synthesize CSM sun-diffuser + dark, derive the dark/relative-response/absolute coefficients back (inverse-crime cure). |
| `isp.py` | S15 — CCSDS Instrument Source Packet + SAD telemetry generation. |
| `io.py` | Lightweight `zarr` reader for EOPF L1A/L1B products (no full EOPF dependency). |
| `l0product.py` | Assembly of the synthetic L0 RAW EOProduct Zarr (the ICD-IF-L0). |

### Data flow
Entry is at-sensor radiance (L1B) in per-detector geometry. The full ATBD §5 reverse chain:

    IN["L1B radiance"]
    S1["S1 · radiance→DN (DN = A·L)"]
    S3["S3 · undo framing"]
    S4["S4 · undo offset (−100)"]
    S5["S5 · undo 60 m binning"]
    S6["S6 · PSF re-blur (ESA matrices; B10 = identity)"]
    S7["S7 · impress relative response"]
    S8["S8 · SWIR re-arrangement (reverse)"]
    S9["S9 · crosstalk"]
    S10["S10 · blind/defective"]
    S11["S11 · re-apply dark (+D)"]
    S12["S12 · reverse onboard equalization"]
    S13["S13 · add noise σ=√(α²+β·DN)"]
    S14["S14 · quantize 12-bit"]
    S15["S15 · format L0 RAW (156 frames + ISP + STAC)"]
    IN --> S1 --> S3 --> S4 --> S5 --> S6 --> S7 --> S8 --> S9 --> S10 --> S11 --> S12 --> S13 --> S14 --> S15
```

The **implemented MVP execution order** (`reverse.reverse_mvp`) is `S1 → S6 → S7 → S13 → S11 → S12 →
S14`: noise (S13) is impressed on the **signal** DN *before* the S11 dark pedestal, so $\sigma = \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta \cdot \mathrm{DN}_\mathrm{signal}}$
reproduces the spec SNR@Lref exactly. `reverse_full` adds S8 (SWIR re-arrangement, reverse) and S10 (defects):
`S1 → S6 → S7 → [S8] → S13 → S11 → S12 → [S10] → S14`. The exact-inverse bridge `reverse_radiometric`
applies only `S1 → S7 → S11 → S12` (no PSF/noise/quantize) so it is algebraically invertible.

### Dependency graph
`sensor` is the foundational leaf (no intra-package imports). `adf` and `gipp` depend on `sensor`;
`forward_radiometric_atbd` depends on `gipp` (`DetectorEq`); `reverse` depends on `adf` (`BandADF`);
`calibration` depends on `adf` + `reverse`; `isp`, `io` and `ccsds122` (CCSDS 122.0-B lossless
image-compression codec, pure numpy) are leaves; `l0product` is the top integrator (imports
`sensor`, `adf`, `reverse`, `isp` — and `ccsds122` once the compressed-ISP payload schema of
ICD-IF-ISP is wired — plus the package version).

## Software dynamic architecture
The software is a synchronous library, not a long-running service: a caller reads an L1A/L1B frame
(`io`), builds a per-band ADF (`adf.from_gipp` / `synthesize`), runs the reverse chain (`reverse`) and
assembles the L0 product (`l0product`). The round-trip V&V and calibration sub-set are driven by the
`scripts/` entry points. There is no internal concurrency requirement; frames are independent and may be
processed in any order (embarrassingly parallel per detector/band).

## Software behaviour
Deterministic for a fixed RNG seed (REQ-QUAL-004). Errors are raised as explicit Python exceptions
(unknown band/unit → `KeyError`; wrong dtype into the L0 writer → `TypeError`). Saturated/no-data pixels
are flagged in the quality masks; the dark pedestal and per-pixel coefficients come from the GIPP
when supplied, else fall back to the published DQR/datasheet values.

## Interfaces context
Inputs: EOPF L1A/L1B Zarr products and the operational GIPP XML. Output: the L0 RAW EOProduct Zarr
(ICD-IF-L0). All interfaces are detailed in the ICD (`docs/icd.md`).

## Memory and CPU budget
Pure NumPy; memory is dominated by the per-detector/band frame arrays (a 10 m band detector image is
~9216 × 2592 float64 ≈ 190 MB transient). PSF kernels are cached. No GPU, no JVM, no external services.
Runtime dependencies: `numpy` (core) and `zarr` (product I/O) only.

## Design standards & conventions
ECSS-E-ST-40C Rev.1 (SDD DRD). Python ≥ 3.11, type-hinted, NumPy-docstring style. All algorithm steps are
implemented originally from the **public L1 ATBD** and the GIPP **data** format — no external processor
source is copied or referenced.
