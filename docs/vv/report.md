# Software verification & validation report

**Project:** Sentinel-2 MSI Reverse E2ES (`s2_e2es`) · **DRD:** ECSS-E-ST-40C Rev.1 (Software verification
report / validation report, SVR). Plan: `plan.md`. Requirements: `../srs.md`.

## 1. Summary

The automated test suite — **52 test functions across 9 files, expanding to 104 parametrized cases —
passes in full (104 passed, 2 skipped), green in GitLab CI**. The 2 skips are the real-data tests, which
pass when `S2_E2ES_GIPP_DIR` / `S2_E2ES_L1A` are supplied (verified on the operational GIPP and a real
L1A). All *realized* requirements in the SRS are verified.

## 2. Test inventory

| Test file | #funcs | Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `test_reverse.py` | 11 | Sensor model (13 bands, no PAN; gains; TDI = B03/B04/B11/B12); S1 radiance↔DN exact; radiometric chain (S1,S7,S11,S12) exactly invertible (rtol 1e-9); PSF radiometry-preserving ($\Sigma=1$); discrete Nyquist MTF; **noise $\sigma=\sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta\cdot\mathrm{DN}}$ within ±5 % over 40 000 px (REQ-FUNC-021 / REQ-PERF-001)**; SNR@Lref reproduction; quantize bounds; MVP output contract |
| `test_real_data.py` | 11 |S2 PSF load/normalisation (33×33, $\Sigma=1$, peak-centred); B10 → identity; per-unit PSF differences;  per-unit SRF centre/bandwidth/equiv-λ; `unit_from_platform`;  noise α,β = product values; **`cal_gain`/`dn_ref` reproduce spec SNR; end-to-end SNR ±5 %**;  spectral metadata |
| `test_calibration.py` | 4 | Calibration sub-set recovery — derived **dark within bound of truth**, **relative-response correlation > 0.9**, $\langle g \rangle = 1$ (±1e-6), **$A \approx$ `cal_gain` (±5 %)**; `estimated_adf` uses derived not truth; dark acquisition carries no scene signal |
| `test_roundtrip_atbd.py` | 3 | **forward_correct ∘ reverse_impress = exact inverse (RMSE < 1e-9 synthetic)**; relative response **flattens FPN (< 0.3× raw)** + recovers flat scene (atol 1e-6); optional real-L1A round-trip (RMSE < 1e-6) |
| `test_l0product.py` | 3 | `reverse_to_l0_frames` uint16 in range; L0 write+reopen structure (band/mask, B8A→b8a, STAC `eopf:type=S2MSIL0_`, TDI list, `physical_gains`, `line_period`, provenance); **full 156-array contract (12×13)** |
| `test_gipp.py` | 5 | R2EQOG cubic + bilinear parse (dark, gains); R2DEPI/BLINDP/R2PARA (−100/−1000)/R2CRCO (≈0); `from_gipp` builds ADF + blind-column width alignment; optional real-GIPP dark in DQR range |
| `test_isp.py` | 8 | CCSDS primary-header round-trip; APID > 2047 rejected; CUC time coarse/fine; frame ISP header shape/seq/length; timestamps step by `line_period`; SAD packets; deterministic 11-bit APID; L0 `with_isp` writes ISP + telemetry |
| `test_integration.py` | 1 | **End-to-end: synthetic L1B → `reverse_full` (S1,S6,S7,S8,S10,S11–S14) + S15 ISP → full L0**, 2 det × 6 bands incl. SWIR re-stagger + injected defects; validates arrays, ISP, masks reflect defects, telemetry,  sensor config |
| `test_inc3_steps.py` | 6 | S4 offset; S5 un-bin (shape+mean); S8 SWIR re-stagger invertible; S9 crosstalk (coeff 0 = identity); S10 defects (dead→0/bit0, hot→4095/bit1); `reverse_full` SWIR+defects contract |

## 3. Quantitative results

| Quantity | Verified bound (test) | Typical observed | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Radiometric round-trip RMSE (synthetic) | < 1e-9 | ~1e-14 | `test_roundtrip_atbd::test_forward_inverse_exact` |
| Radiometric round-trip RMSE (L1A DN) | < 1e-6 | ~1e-14 | `roundtrip_real_l1a.py`, `test_real_l1a_roundtrip_exact` |
| Calibration dark recovery | ≤ 0.5 DN | ~0.05 DN | `test_calibration` (bound); ATBD §4 (typical) |
| Calibration relative-response correlation | > 0.9 | > 0.99 | `test_calibration` (bound); ATBD §4 (typical) |
| Calibration absolute coefficient `A` | ±5 % of `cal_gain` | ≈ `cal_gain` | `test_calibration` |
| Noise $\sigma$ accuracy | ±5 % over ≥ $10^4$ px | within ±5 % | `test_reverse` (REQ-PERF-001) |
| SNR@Lref reproduction | ±5 % end-to-end | < 1 % | `test_real_data` (REQ-PERF-002) |
| FPN flattening by equalization | corrected < 0.3× raw | ~0 (flat recovered) | `test_roundtrip_atbd` |

The round-trip and FPN results were also confirmed visually on the L1A (B03 cloud imagery; the
residual image is featureless ⇒ exact inverse) via `scripts/save_images.py`.

## 4. Requirements verification status

All *realized* SRS requirements are verified **PASS** by the cited method:
- **REQ-FUNC-001/003/005/010–022/030–034/044/045/046/047** — T (see the inventory and `../sdd/traceability.md`).
- **REQ-PERF-001…004** — T/A, results in §3, all within bounds.
- **REQ-IF-001/002/003** — I/T (L1A/L1B + GIPP inputs, L0 ICD output).
- **REQ-QUAL-001…004** — I/R/T (minimal deps; 104-test CI; originality review; seeded determinism).
- Deferred / cancelled requirements (REQ-FUNC-043/053/062, REQ-FUNC-090) are out of this verification cycle.

## 5. Anomalies & observations

- **Doc/test bound discrepancy (closed):** the ATBD prose quotes calibration dark recovery `< 0.05 DN` and
  correlation `> 0.99`; the committed unit tests assert the looser, robust bounds `≤ 0.5 DN` and `> 0.9`.
  The looser figures are the **verified** acceptance bounds; the tighter figures are the **typical observed**
  values. No action required.
- **Test L1A fixture:** the publicly available EOPF test L1A is DN-scaled (not a physically-calibrated
  radiance product), so absolute-radiometry comparisons use the round-trip self-consistency and the real
  GIPP; this does not affect the verified inverse-exactness or calibration-recovery results.
